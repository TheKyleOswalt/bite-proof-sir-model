# bite-proof-sir-model
This repository contains R code for simulating Dengue transmission using an SIR model. The model adjusts bite rates to reflect protective clothing effects and simulates outbreaks with varying levels of protection. It provides visualizations of different population dynamics (e.g., susceptible, infected, recovered).
